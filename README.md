# Portfolio

## Description
My motivation to build this project was to mainly get an idea of what my personal portfolio would look like once I am done with the course. This is a simple visualization of the layout and what I want my portfolio to include, I hope to include more elements and projects that I will be working on in the future for my future employers to see. I learned throughout this portfolio project that many factors come into account when creating a website from scratch and debugging takes a lot of time to accomplish.
