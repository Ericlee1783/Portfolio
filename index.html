            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio, I am please to introduce myself to everyone. My name is Jeong Won (Eric) Lee and I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea before moving to the US back in 2008. I was raised in Southern California ever since and graduated high school in the city of Brea. I am currently pursuing the career of web development through the UCLA extension program despite graduating with a Bachelors degree in Hospitality Management from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I would describe myself versatile and already having the soft skills coming from a hospitality career, I wish to push myself to learn more about the tech industry to pursue a career in the field.
